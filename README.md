A Python/C(++) implementation of Hartigan & Hartigan's dip test for unimodality.

The dip test measures multimodality in a sample by the maximum difference, over
all sample points, between the empirical distribution function, and the
unimodal distribution function that minimizes that maximum difference. Other
than unimodality, it makes no further assumptions about the form of the null
distribution.

## Dependencies
* `numpy`
* [Optional] `OpenMP`

Parallelisation of the p-value computation using bootstrapping is offered using OpenMP.
OpenMP is disabled by default but can be enabled, see installation section
below.
 Multi-threading can be turned off by setting the number of threads equal to 1. See the docstring of `diptest` for details.


## Installation

diptest can be installed from PyPi using:

```bash
    pip install diptest
```

Wheels containing the pre-compiled extension are available for:

- Windows x84-64 - CPython 3.7 - 3.10
- Linux x84-64 - CPython 3.7 - 3.10
- MacOS x84-64 - CPython 3.7 - 3.10
- MacOS ARM-64 - CPython 3.8 - 3.10

If you have a C/C++ compiler available it is advised to install without
the wheel as this enables architecture specific optimisations.

```bash
    pip install diptest --no-binary diptest
```

Compatible compilers through Pybind11:

- Clang/LLVM 3.3 or newer (for Apple Xcode's clang, this is 5.0.0 or newer)
- GCC 4.8 or newer
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 or newer
- Intel classic C++ compiler 18 or newer (ICC 20.2 tested in CI)
- Cygwin/GCC (previously tested on 2.5.1)
- NVCC (CUDA 11.0 tested in CI)
- NVIDIA PGI (20.9 tested in CI)

#### Enable OpenMP

To enable OpenMP use:
```bash
    CMAKE_ARGS="-DDIPTEST_ENABLE_OPENMP=ON" pip install diptest --no-binary diptest
```

#### Debug installation

To enable a debug build use:
```bash
    CMAKE_ARGS="-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" pip install diptest --no-binary diptest
```

#### Debug printing

To enable the debug print statements use:
```bash
    CMAKE_ARGS="-DDIPTEST_ENABLE_DEBUG=ON" pip install diptest --no-binary diptest
```
then call the function with debug argument set to a value greater than zero:
```python3
    diptest(x, debug=1)
```

## Usage

This library provides two functions:
* `dipstat`
* `diptest`

The first only computes Hartigan's dip statistic. `diptest` computes both the
statistic and the p-value. The p-value can be computed using interpolation of a
critical value table (default) or by bootstrapping the null hypothesis.
Note that for larger samples (N > 1e5) this is quite compute and memory intensive.

```python3
    import numpy as np
    import diptest

    # generate some bimodal random draws
    N = 1000
    hN = N // 2
    x = np.empty(N, dtype=np.float64)
    x[:hN] = np.random.normal(0.4, 1.0, hN)
    x[hN:] = np.random.normal(-0.4, 1.0, hN)

    # only the dip statistic
    dip = diptest.dipstat(x)
    
    # both the dip statistic and p-value
    dip, pval = diptest.diptest(x)
```

## Acknowledgement

`diptest` is just a Python port of [Martin Maechler's R module of the same
name](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diptest/index.html).
The package wrapping the C implementation was originally written by [Alistair Muldal](https://github.com/alimuldal/diptest).
The fork is an update with a number of changes:
* Fixes a buffer overrun issue in `_dip.c` by reverting to the original C implementation
* Python bindings using Pybind11 (C++) instead of Cython
* P-value computation using bootstrapping has been moved down to C++ with optional parallelisation support through OpenMP
* Removed overhead caused by debug branching statements by placing them under a compile-time definition
* Added tests and wheel support
